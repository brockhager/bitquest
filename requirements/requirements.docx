BitQuest

There are a lot of things that can be created within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Gaming is the next evolvement with digital currency. The idea is to have an open world platform that anyone can join and begin playing. It is multiplayer so every user that joins becomes part of a team. (Not sure if they will get to pick their team OR if we will need to load balance to make the teams even. Also, some people that are friends will join and they will need to be on the same team. See balancing of teams.)

































F. A. Q. 

How do I Start?
The first screen is a login screen
The next screen after that shows all the pre-game options
Training Facility and Kill Delay should be optional.  (When users first play, these will be checked by default. After playing 3x then they are unchecked by default)

Gameplay:
Player1 is dropped at a random spawnpoint. 
[When a player first starts, it should be easy to start playing right away. ]


What are Team Colors?
Users pick a team color on the pre-game options screen
(Should only be enough team colors available for the number of nations on the map;
Reserved colors are not available – like Yellow due to Safe Zones (F);
Only colors for current teams are available;
Should be an option if they want to create a new team;
Need to force-balance teams so 1 team does not get too many people; )


Do I choose a User Name?
Yes you can. Users can type any name they want;  (pending certain reserved words or swear words)
You can enter the game without entering one, but then a generic username will be given to you. 


What else happens at that START of the game?
Every player starts with:
100 coins
100 lifepoints
300 in ammo (bubbles?)
(Each 1 of the 3 listed above equal 1 satoshi)
1 coin = 1 lifepoint = 1 ammo = 0.00000001 BTC







Do I have to pay real money to play this game??
Yes - but it equals out to be less than a fraction of a penny.  ($00.001)


Huh?
Once it gains popularity, users will pay 300 satoshis in order to play this game. 
Today’s value = 0.001268 USD or one tenth of a cent  (  < 0.01)


What is this game similar to?
Gameplay based on:
Risk - capturing nations; defeating enemies; gain armies; (gain satoshis)
Age of Empires - gameplay, attacking nations, defeating enemies, etc. 
Agar.io - simplicity; instant gameplay; attack other players; 
Minecraft - graphics; gameplay; open world framework; 
Zelda - encountering enemies and world-discovery
Starcraft - world-discovery; teams; join forces; minerals as money; black cloud gameplay;
AA 2.5 - balancing of teams; ghosting; having objectives; 
Capture the Flag - This will be a side element; Good when players run out of ammo; 
	Takes users to jail; 
H1Z1 - Survival; Sandbox; MMOG; 



Is satoshis and items in the game transferred to real life?
Yes. However, we are still sorting out Real Life Legitimacy
[Need to clarify this, but in order so that we aren’t just “creating money out of thin air” we should  have to financially back all coins and “virtual items” in the game with actual BTC in a cold wallet. ]
[Can only add users if we have the financial backing to add them. (Or they can buy in for their own account)	(NEED CLARIFICATION)  ]


What TERMS are used in this guide?
Terms
GS		Gridsquare			Square on the map that players are trying to control; 
KDT		Kingdom_Deed_Token	Given to team that controls all gridsquares/nations
LDT 		Land_Deed_Token		1 per GS; Given to owner of GS
		Nation				Territory made up of Gridsquares
		Teams				Groups that players join when game starts
		Armies				Formed from teams once team has entire Nation;





Other Terms


Ammo
-Each ammo cost 1 satoshi. 
-When a player STARTS on the map (spawns) they will receive 300 ammo for free. After that they will need to purchase ammo. 
-Need to test out scenarios to see what the best starting amount is. 
-You kill other players in the game by shooting them with ammo. 
-See also “Game Currency and Ammo”

Ammo Pods 
-These are spread out throughout the map. Can not move them. +1 ammo every 3 seconds you touch it.
(NEED CLARIFICATION)

Air Strikes - (Phase 2)
-Users can call down airstrikes. 
-Players get 1 airstrike per game.
-Additional airstrikes can be purchased. 

Army
-When a nation is fully captured, they have the ability to create a national army
-If players from the same team fight in a group they are called a militia
(NEED CLARIFICATION)

Balancing of Teams
-When a player joins a server, they may have the option to pick a nation to join. (pick color)
-Need to discuss this because some friends will join and they will want to be on the same team. This is important because we want to try and prevent Ghosting. Ghosting is where player1 is on blue team and player2 is on red team. They are friends IRL and they are communicating IRL over teamspeak or phone, etc. The first person that dies then reports to the other player the location of other players. To prevent this, we need to have teammates be on teams. 
-Will also need to balance the number of players on each team for each server. 








Bazaar
-This will be a marketplace where players can buy coins and other items. No one can shoot while in the bazaar and can not be shot. 
-This is considered a building and it should be similar to a Safe Zone as far as the rules of engagement go. 
-The Bazaar is ran by the Head Broker who is always at the bazaar. 

Bond 
-Bond can be paid by an opposing player that is being held in a nation’s jail. Not sure what this will cost. 
-Should be standard across all nations. 
-When they pay bond they are safely transported back to their home country. 
(Bond is similar to monopoly where you pay $50 to get out of jail.)

Bounty
-Gameplay is based on a bounty system.  When player1 kills player2 then player1 will have an opportunity to get “a certain amount” of player2’s money. (Possibly all the money in hot wallet)
-Possibly have a hot wallet and cold wallet for each player. A hot wallet is the satoshis that they collect for that round. If they die, all of the satoshis fall out of player2’s pockets and it is on the ground. Free for all for any players in the area to get all player2’s satoshis. 
-Before any round starts, the user has the option to move BTC between their hot wallet and cold wallet. Cold wallet funds are secure regardless if they die during a round. 
-Players can set the amount of money in their hot wallet at the beginning of the round. 
-Players can only buy stuff in-game if they have money in their hot wallet  (See WALLETS)

Boundary
-A national boundary is one that shows on the map of the border of each nation. 
-Nations will share boundary lines with other nations. 
-There should be Safe Zones throughout Satoshi Kingdom. 

Buildings
Jail		See Jail
Hospital  	Gets lifepoints here
Armory		Buy Ammo here
Bazaar		Buy coins from the Head Broker

Capture a player
-Bitquest will have a “capture the flag” feature. The rules are basically the same. If you are a blue team player and there is a red team player in the blue team nation, then you are able to “capture” the red team player by moving up to that player and moving over them so that you can “secure” them. There should be an automatic transport that arrives and transports them to jail. 



Capture the Nation
-Capture all gridsquares in a Nation and the user / team captures that Nation; Winning player gets to type a name of the nation; Would need to have a list of banned words (F-word, S-word, etc.)

-Once the nation is captured, it remains that team’s color (on their flag) until the entire border gridsquares are captured by a team of a different color. For example, if blue team captures all the gridsquares, the nation’s flag will remain blue until all gridsquares that are alligned to the border have been captured by another team. (Even if it is multiple teams)  At that point, the flag becomes white/neutral colored and the nation is considered unowned. 

COINS
-Coins are satoshis. They have real life value that users can withdraw at any time by entering a wallet address. They can be stored in a user’s hot wallet or cold wallet. 
-Players can “send” coins to other players in the game using the Q key on the keyboard. 

Communication and Connecting
-Messages
-Direct Message
-Chat
-Users should have the ability to add another player as a friend in the game
-Need to find a way to have real life friends join the same team. (Prevent Ghosting)
-Players should be able to see their own teammates in the game and on the mini-map

Economy
See page 12 for details on the Economy of Satoshi Kingdom

Framework 
-Open world map framework;  Players can move freely over entire map except for obstacles. 
-The map should NOT be flat. There should be hills and obstacles so that it makes it harder for users to see each other. This adds a layer of complexity. (See Layout)
-A user can create an account with their email address. 1 email = 1 account
-There should be a test area where players can practice. 
-1 life per hour. If they die, they must wait 1 hour to respawn. Respawn should be near Safe Zone AND should have a kill delay option of 2 minutes  (NEED CLARIFICATION)
-No MAX on ammo, lifepoints, or coins.  (NEED CLARIFICATION)








Fence (phase 2)
-A fence is an object in the game that users can use to protect themselves from other players that are trying to shoot them. 
-Players should be able to push the fence into position and then hide behind it. 
-Fences can block bubbles/ammo. Can move a fence by pushing it. 
-When you secure a nation you get extra fences. There should be 1 fence in each square at the start. 

Game currency and Ammo:
-Ammo = Bubbles; 1 bubble cost 0.00000001;
-Currency = Coins; Users can “shoot” coins to other users using “Q” button; If they miss, anyone can grab them; (finders keepers)  Could also have random currency around the game; Game must have ability to deposit and withdraw funds IRL to another bitcoin wallet
 
Starting balance = 	100 in ammo, lifepoints, and coins
Each Kill = 		20
Bounty = 		(set amount)  (phase 2)
Bubble = 		1
GridSquare = 		50
Nation = 		Pot (winnings will come from a pot that collects satoshis over time)

Gridsquares
-Need gridlines over entire map; Each gridsquare is identified with ID number
-Players must battle other players for current gridsquare they are in;
-All gridquares in a nation must be captured before the nation is considered taken. 

Gridsquare Control
-You get control of an open gridsquare if you are the only team on it for 10 seconds OR you are the first to kill 5 enemies on that square (still undecided)
-If Team Blue has control of that square, a different team would need to stand on that square for 30 seconds OR kill 5 blue team members on that square to get control of it

Jail
-Every nation has 1 jail. When an opposing player is captured, they are transported to that nation’s jail. (similar to capture the flag)
-Players can be released from jail by either a jail break or they can pay bond. 







Jail Break
-An opposing player can cause a jail break if they find the jail and move up to it and they “break” the jail open. They have to move up to any wall of the jail and hold himself on the same point of the wall for x seconds. (possibly 20 seconds?) That will cause a hole big enough for captured players to escape. As they escape they will still be in an opposing territory and can be caught and transported back to jail. 

Kill Delay
-Users cannot be shot / killed for first 2 minutes when they START.   
(This is optional. By default it is checked/applied)

Layout
-Spawnpoints should be in areas of the map that are secluded and away from other users if possible. This promotes safety while also allowing player to adjust to surroundings right away. 
-Servers should auto balance. See Balancing of Teams
-The map should have hills and valleys. This is similar to AA 2.5 where you have maps that can be hilly and players are only allowed to see a specific distance. 
-Maps could also have fog, dust storms, and other natural weather that makes visibility difficult.
-All of these features make the game more realistic
-Ideally gridsquares are about the same size across the entire map. This can vary based on obstacles and also because we do not want this to be a square map overall. We want this to feel like a kingdom or nation IRL

Lifepoints
-This is how you can tell if a player is alive or dead. 
-Players start with 100 when they START. 
-When the player’s lifepoints reach 0, they are dead. 
-After a player is dead, they must respawn. 
-When a player dies, all the satoshi in their hot wallet is released to the map where their body is. 
-The player’s body is dead on the map for 10 seconds. 
-Possible that users can find their way to Life Pods in order to get more life

Life Pods
-These are spread out throughout the map. 
-Can not move them. +1 life every second you touch it.
(NEED CLARIFICATION)

Lotto - (Phase 2)
-Can be a Jackpot
-Users can buy in for 1 satoshi and a drawing and winner every hour




Map
-Still deciding if there should be an option to bring up a larger map or only have mini-map

Mini-Map
-There should be a mini-map in the lower left corner
-Players need to be able to see where they are at on the map
-It should show various objects on the map

Obstacles 
-rocks
-water		(user can drown in water)
-giant trees  
-Users cannot move through obstacles
-Users can move into the water. If they are over 50% in the water, they will drown. 
-See Layout

Respawn
-Respawn points are random throughout the map

Rewards
See rewards section under Economy of Satoshi Kingdom 

Safe Zones
-Need Safe Zones (yellow for now)
-Safe Zones are areas of the map where players cannot shoot or be shot. 
-Players cannot be captured in safe zones. 

Satoshi Kingdom
-This is the name of the entire world for BitQuest.
-If a team would conquer all gridsquares and then all nations, then they would eventually capture the entire kingdom of Satoshi. 
-Named after the creator of bitcoin

Spawnpoint
-Random place on map where users are dropped. 







Training Facility
-Users should have the option to transport there at any time.
-The gridsquares surrounding this place should be yellow so players aren’t killed right away; (See also Kill Delay)
-If not dropped near Training Facility then there should be a pop up that asks if they want to be transported to TF

Transport
-Transport is a generic vehicle that moves players around the board. 
-Transports are neutral and do not belong to any team or nation. 
-Players cannot shoot or be shot while in the transport. 
-Could possibly just have players pay for transport instead of using TUBES
-Users can purchase rides. (Need to discuss how this would work because we don’t want users to continue to use transports to get out of trouble.)
-MAX of 1 transport ride per round 

Examples:
-A player pays bond and is transported back to his home country. 
-A player is captured and needs transported to that nation’s jail.
-A player has pushed the button for the Training Facility. They should be transported there. 

(NEED CLARIFICATION)

Tubes - (Phase 2)
-These are throughout the map that allows users to “jump” to another part of the map.  This will save travel time for users; Allow each person to be able to set 1 up each game. If they close the map or die, but they have already set one up they should not keep getting extra tubes to set up. -Only 1 for each saved map;
-MAX of 4 per nation
-Players should be able to destroy their own Tubes  (Then they can set up a new one if available)
-Could possibly just have players pay for transport instead of using TUBES
(Not sure if this will be a thing or not) 











Wallets
-Players have cold wallets and hot wallet when they play BitQuest
-Players have the OPTION at START to move funds from cold wallet to hot wallet
-Should be a default amount that they start with because they will not know what they should have when they start playing the first time. 
(example:  300 coins in hot wallet)
-coins and satoshis are the same thing
-When a player is killed, he loses all the money in his hot wallet
-When a player is killed, he does NOT lose any money in his cold wallet
-Having this concept of wallets will spread knowledge and adoption for any new bitcoin users that are playing the game































Economy of Satoshi Kingdom

Individual Players
Currency:
The currency is simple… 1 satoshi = 1 coin
1 Ammo = 1 coin
1 Lifepoint = 1 coin 		(health)

LDT 		Land_Deed_Token
KDT		Kingdom_Deed_Token
GS		Gridsquare

Land
Land has value but not in satoshis
Land’s value is represented by LDTs

Nations
-Each nation - once captured by a team - is officially recognized as a nation by the entire Kingdom
-That team then assumes control of the National Wallet
-When a nation is completely taken over, there is a Land_Deed_Token (LDT) for that nation. That LDT for that nation is held by the same team until another team has completely taken every GS from the current team that holds the LDT for that nation. 
-In the same way, once all nations have been taken by 1 team, then they receive the Kingdom_Deed_Token (KDT) for the entire Kingdom. There should be a ceremony that shows that. That team then holds the KDT until the next nation-capture by an opposing team. Once a nation has be captured by a different team, the previous team that held the KDT loses it and it is returned to the game-moderator. 

National Wallet
A wallet that collects funds for that nation. 
When a gridsquare is controled, the Land_Deed_Token is placed into that team’s National Wallet
Even though a team may lose a lot of territory (gridsquares) they still have a national wallet. (NW)

-Each gridsquare (GS) should have a Land_Deed_Token. (LDT) 
-Whatever team conquers that GS then controls that corresponding LDT
-There is 1 LDT per GS. The exact LDT represents ownership of that GS
(When a GS is conquered, there should be a short 5 sec ceremony of transfer of ownership)
-LDTs cannot be bought or sold






Rewards
There are rewards given to individuals for accomplishments. 

Their team getting x number of LDT = x satoshi
Their team getting control of KDT = x satoshi
	(National Wallet getting KDT)
Their team keeping control of KDT for 10 minutes = x satoshi
National Wallet getting x number of LDT = x satoshi
National Wallet keeping x number of LDT = x satoshi


User Account Points (UAP)
Besides being rewarded with satoshis, each user also will have a rating that will show how many points they have. Each new account starts with 100 points. Shown below are all the possible ways to get and lose points:

Kill					+5
Die					-5
Purchase 10 satoshis			+10
Purchase 10 ammo			+10
Purchase 10 lifepoints			+10
On team when they get LDT (GS)	+15
On team when they get a Nation	+50
On team when they get KDT		+150
